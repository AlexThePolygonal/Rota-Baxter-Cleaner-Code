abstract={We prove that all Rota--Baxter operators on a quadratic division algebra are trivial. For nonzero weight, we state that all Rota--Baxter operators on the simple odd-dimensional Jordan algebra of bilinear form are projections on a subalgebra along another one. For weight zero, we find a connection between the Rota--Baxter operators and the solutions to the alternative Yang--Baxter equation on the Cayley--Dickson algebra. We also investigate the Rota--Baxter operators on the matrix algebras of order two, the Grassmann algebra of plane, and the Kaplansky superalgebra.},

abstract = {Rota–Baxter operators or relations were introduced to solve certain analytic and combinatorial problems and then applied to many fields in mathematics and mathematical physics. In this paper, we commence to study the Rota–Baxter operators of weight zero on a 4-dimensional complex simple associative algebra, which is isomorphic to the algebra of all 2×2 matrices over the field of complex numbers. Such operators satisfy (the operator form of) the classical Yang–Baxter equation on the general linear Lie algebra gl2(C). We provide two different solving methods: one by hand to show some tricks for solving a large nonlinear system, and another one by Computer Algebra to show the possibility of solving higher dimensional cases.}
